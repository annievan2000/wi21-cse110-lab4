# Dev Tools Debugging
1. The bug was that num1 and num2 were viewed as strings, so the plus sign concatnated the two together. We wanted the sum, so this bug made the program incorrect.
2. I fixed it by typecasting num1 and num2 in the calculateSum function to be numbers. This allowed the two numbers to be added together correctly and return the correct sum.
